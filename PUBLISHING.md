# Publishing

This repository publishes npm packages under the `@le-space/*` scope.

The release process is already live and is handled through GitHub Actions.

## Current Published Package Set

The currently maintained publishable packages are:

- `@le-space/shared-types`
- `@le-space/core`
- `@le-space/node`
- `@le-space/rootfs`
- `@le-space/ui`

Not currently published:

- `@le-space/browser`

`browser` remains intentionally unreleased until the browser and wallet-driven
deployment API is real and stable.

## Release Workflow

The canonical release workflow is:

- `.github/workflows/release-packages.yml`

It supports:

- dry-run packaging
- real npm publishing
- configurable npm tag
- configurable npm scope
- optional provenance flag

## Required Secret

Real publishing requires:

- `NPM_TOKEN`

That token must have publish rights for the `@le-space` npm scope.

## Release Model

This repo currently uses aligned package versions across the publishable set.

That means a normal release updates:

- `packages/shared-types/package.json`
- `packages/core/package.json`
- `packages/node/package.json`
- `packages/rootfs/package.json`
- `packages/ui/package.json`

to the same version.

## Local Validation Before Release

Recommended checks before publishing:

```bash
pnpm test
pnpm docs:build
pnpm build:publishable
pnpm publish:prepare
```

Focused package checks:

```bash
pnpm --filter @le-space/shared-types test
pnpm --filter @le-space/core test
pnpm --filter @le-space/rootfs test
pnpm --filter @le-space/node test
```

## Dry Run

Use the GitHub workflow with:

- `dry_run = true`
- `npm_tag = next`
- `npm_scope = le-space`

This produces tarballs without publishing them.

Use dry runs when:

- changing package metadata
- changing `prepare-publish.mjs`
- changing workspace package names
- changing release workflow behavior

## Real Publish

Use the GitHub workflow with:

- `dry_run = false`
- `npm_tag = next` or `latest`
- `npm_scope = le-space`

Typical release flow:

1. bump the package versions
2. validate locally
3. push to `main`
4. run `Release Packages`
5. confirm npm publish succeeded
6. update consumer repos to the new version where needed

## Packaging Model

The repository remains source-first in workspace development, but creates
publishable artifacts into `dist/` before release.

Important helpers:

- `pnpm build:publishable`
- `pnpm publish:prepare`
- `scripts/prepare-publish.mjs`
- `scripts/publish-from-dist.mjs`

## Consumer Follow-Up

After a release, consumer repositories such as `universal-connectivity` may
need to:

1. bump the `@le-space/node` version in workflows
2. rerun their Aleph workflows
3. verify that the new shared package version behaves correctly end to end

That final consumer validation is especially important after:

- package namespace changes
- release pipeline changes
- rootfs runner changes
- site runner changes
- deployment or retention logic changes
