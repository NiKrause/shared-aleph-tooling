# Aleph Bootstrap

`@le-space/aleph-bootstrap` is the shared package for relay bootstrap
registration and discovery on Aleph.

It covers two sides of the flow:

1. relay deployment paths publish fresh public multiaddrs as Aleph `POST`
   messages
2. browser or Node libp2p apps query those posts before creating their
   bootstrap peer discovery service

## Default Namespace

The current shared namespace is:

- channel: `simple-todo`
- ref: `simple-todo-bootstrap`
- post type: `relay-bootstrap`

These defaults are exported, but every value can be overridden when a consumer
needs an app-specific namespace.

## Relay Registration

The shared deploy flows now register bootstrap addresses automatically for the
`uc-go-peer` and `orbitdb-relay-pinner` RootFS profiles when they are launched
through:

- the shared GitHub Action VM deploy path
- the Sponsor Relay browser UI path

The registration payload stores:

- `peerId`
- `multiaddrs`
- `browserMultiaddrs`
- `registrationId` when a producer can provide a stable relay identity
- `profile`
- `version`
- `updatedAt`

Only public multiaddrs are published. Loopback, RFC1918, link-local, and
localhost-style addresses are filtered out before the Aleph `POST` is signed.

### Current Signing Model

Today the codebase supports two bootstrap signing shapes:

- legacy wallet-signed records
- dual-key records with owner authorization plus relay proof

Current profile behavior:

- `uc-go-peer`
  - when `ALEPH_VM_BOOTSTRAP_PUBLISHER_PRIVATE_KEY` is supplied, the deploy
    flow derives a libp2p secp256k1 identity from that same publisher key `B`
  - that protobuf-encoded libp2p key is written into the guest before first
    start, so the relay `peerId` comes from the same underlying key material
    as the Aleph publisher identity
  - if owner key `A` is also supplied, the owner authorization can be minted
    up front and stored in the first guest configure call
- `orbitdb-relay-pinner`
  - now also accepts a preseeded libp2p secp256k1 identity derived from
    publisher key `B`
  - when publisher key `B` is supplied, the relay `peerId` comes from the
    same underlying key material as the Aleph publisher identity
  - when publisher key `B` is not supplied, it falls back to the older
    self-generated Ed25519 relay identity
  - in that fallback mode, owner authorization is still written back into the
    guest with a second `no_start` configure call after runtime metadata is
    known

So the remaining trust gap is now narrower than before:

- `uc-go-peer` can already bind publisher key `B` and relay `peerId` to the
  same secp256k1 root
- `orbitdb-relay-pinner` can now do the same when publisher key `B` is
  supplied
- legacy wallet-signed records are still accepted by default for backward
  compatibility

### Target Signing Model

The intended next model is a **dual-key relay bootstrap record**.

Roles:

- owner key `A`: the deployment wallet that creates or sponsors the Aleph VM
- relay key `B`: a separate key held by the running relay VM

Target proof chain:

1. owner key `A` signs an authorization statement for relay key `B`
2. relay key `B` signs the current bootstrap record payload
3. the bootstrap `POST` is published by relay key `B`
4. readers verify both signatures before trusting the record

This gives the relay enough autonomy to refresh its own bootstrap record while
still preserving a cryptographic relationship to the original deployment
wallet.

Important design note:

- this is intentionally a **dual-key** model
- it replaces earlier ideas about reusing the deployer wallet directly or
  relying on Aleph-specific publish-on-behalf delegation as the primary long
  term design
- if the relay peer identity is later made compatible with the same signing
  key material, that can simplify verification further, but the baseline plan
  is still dual-key authorization plus relay-side signing

### Current Transport Reality

Today, `shared-aleph-tooling` submits those signed Aleph `POST` messages
through Aleph's HTTP/Core Channel Node gateway.

Aleph's platform documentation also describes peer-to-peer message broadcast as
another supported transport, but the practical first-party integration surface
we found for that path is Aleph's separate `p2p-service` bridge rather than a
browser-ready TypeScript SDK.

That means the current implementation should be understood as:

- decentralized at the wallet-signing layer
- gateway-based at submission time
- public and REST-queryable at read time

## App Discovery

Typical discovery looks like this:

```ts
import { createLibp2pAlephBootstrap } from '@le-space/aleph-bootstrap'

const alephBootstrap = await createLibp2pAlephBootstrap()
```

If an app wants only the raw multiaddr list, call:

```ts
import { discoverAlephBootstrapMultiaddrs } from '@le-space/aleph-bootstrap'

const list = await discoverAlephBootstrapMultiaddrs()
```

By default, discovery:

- queries `https://api2.aleph.im/api/v0/posts.json`
- loads the shared `relay-bootstrap` posts
- skips entries older than 7 days
- keeps only the newest fresh record per relay identity
- deduplicates the returned multiaddrs
- prefers `browserMultiaddrs` when available
- verifies dual-key records when they are present

Important caveat:

- the 7-day cutoff is our application-level freshness rule
- we still do not have source-backed proof from Aleph's public docs about when
  ordinary bootstrap `POST` messages are automatically pruned, if ever
- relays should eventually republish and forget their own old bootstrap records
  instead of assuming network-side cleanup

Current implementation detail:

- when a bootstrap record includes `registrationId`, discovery collapses to the
  newest fresh record for that relay identity
- otherwise discovery falls back to the newest fresh record per sender address
- invalid dual-key records are ignored during discovery
- legacy wallet-signed records are still accepted by default

Discovery can be tightened further with:

- `verifyDualKeyAttestation: true`
  This is the default behavior for posts that already carry dual-key proof
  objects.
- `requireDualKeyAttestation: true`
  This rejects legacy wallet-signed records and only accepts dual-key-attested
  relay registrations.

Example:

```ts
import { discoverAlephBootstrapMultiaddrs } from '@le-space/aleph-bootstrap'

const list = await discoverAlephBootstrapMultiaddrs({
  requireDualKeyAttestation: true,
})
```

### Dual-Key Helpers

The package now also exposes low-level helpers for dual-key record creation and
verification:

- `signRelayBootstrapAuthorization(...)`
- `signRelayBootstrapProof(...)`
- `verifyRelayBootstrapAuthorization(...)`
- `verifyRelayBootstrapProof(...)`
- `verifyRelayBootstrapDualKeyContent(...)`
- `relayBootstrapTrustMode(...)`

## Validation

The shared monorepo now has two validation layers for this flow:

- local unit coverage in `packages/aleph-bootstrap/test` and
  `packages/core/test/bootstrap-registration.test.ts`
- an opt-in live round-trip script at `scripts/test-aleph-bootstrap-live.mjs`

Run the deterministic local checks with:

```bash
pnpm --filter @le-space/aleph-bootstrap test
pnpm --filter @le-space/core test
```

Run the live Aleph round-trip with a funded or otherwise valid wallet key:

```bash
ALEPH_BOOTSTRAP_TEST_PRIVATE_KEY=0xyourkey pnpm test:aleph-bootstrap:live
```

The live check:

- publishes dummy public multiaddrs into Aleph as a `relay-bootstrap` `POST`
- republishes the same relay identity with refreshed public multiaddrs
- requests `FORGET` for the older bootstrap record
- polls `posts.json` until the refreshed post is visible
- re-runs discovery through `discoverAlephBootstrapMultiaddrs()`
- verifies that private and localhost multiaddrs were filtered out
- verifies that discovery selects the refreshed browser bootstrap addrs instead
  of the older ones

An optional variant also uses a fresh random ephemeral wallet key:

```bash
ALEPH_BOOTSTRAP_TEST_USE_EPHEMERAL_KEY=true pnpm test:aleph-bootstrap:live
```

In our live testing, that ephemeral-key mode was also accepted by Aleph for the
same bootstrap `POST` and `FORGET` lifecycle. For this bootstrap flow, that is
strong evidence that public write access is effectively open to arbitrary valid
keys, which reinforces the need for consumer-side anti-spam handling.

## Periodic Refresh

Two refresh paths now exist:

- external `@le-space/node` `refresh-bootstrap` mode
- in-guest periodic refresh from the relay VM itself

`@le-space/node` now supports:

```bash
ALEPH_VM_MODE=refresh-bootstrap
```

Expected environment inputs:

- `ALEPH_VM_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `ALEPH_VM_NAME`
- `ALEPH_VM_PROFILE`
- `ALEPH_VM_RELAY_PEER_ID`
- `ALEPH_VM_PROBE_MULTIADDRS_JSON`
- `ALEPH_VM_BROWSER_BOOTSTRAP_MULTIADDRS_JSON`
- optional `ALEPH_VM_ROOTFS_VERSION`
- optional `ALEPH_VM_BOOTSTRAP_REGISTRATION_ID`
- optional `ALEPH_VM_BOOTSTRAP_FORGET_PREVIOUS`
- optional `ALEPH_VM_PUBLISHER_PRIVATE_KEY`
- optional `ALEPH_VM_OWNER_PRIVATE_KEY`

That mode republishes the relay bootstrap registration and, by default,
forgets older self-owned records for the same registration ID.

Current dual-key behavior in external `refresh-bootstrap`:

- if only `ALEPH_VM_PRIVATE_KEY` is set, refresh behaves like the legacy
  wallet-signed model
- if `ALEPH_VM_PUBLISHER_PRIVATE_KEY` is set, the relay bootstrap `POST` is
  published by that publisher identity
- if `ALEPH_VM_OWNER_PRIVATE_KEY` is also set, the refresh path embeds the
  owner authorization plus relay proof objects automatically

This external mode remains useful for one-off repair or manual refresh, but it
is no longer the only heartbeat path.

Current in-guest refresh behavior:

- deploy/configure stores `ALEPH_BOOTSTRAP_PUBLISHER_PRIVATE_KEY`,
  `ALEPH_BOOTSTRAP_REGISTRATION_ID`, and a base64-encoded
  `ALEPH_BOOTSTRAP_OWNER_AUTHORIZATION_B64` record in the relay VM env file
- both relay profiles can additionally store a precomputed libp2p secp256k1
  identity derived from publisher key `B`, so the runtime `peerId` is known
  before the relay first starts
- if `orbitdb-relay-pinner` is deployed without publisher key `B`, it still
  generates owner authorization after the real relay `peerId` is known and
  writes it back into the guest with a second `no_start` configure call
- the guest runs a systemd timer:
  - `uc-go-peer-bootstrap-refresh.timer`
  - `orbitdb-relay-pinner-bootstrap-refresh.timer`
- the timer invokes a local Python refresher that:
  - calls the profile-specific `*-describe.py` helper
  - signs the relay proof with publisher key `B`
  - republishes the bootstrap `POST`
  - forgets older self-owned records for the same registration ID

This keeps the owner key `A` out of the long-lived guest state once the
authorization record has been minted.

## P2P Direction

The current architectural direction is not to replace REST reads immediately,
but to investigate a hybrid model:

- P2P or P2P-bridge publication for live bootstrap announcements
- REST `posts.json` discovery for startup, history, pagination, and browser
  backfill

This is based on the current Aleph ecosystem shape:

- Aleph documents P2P broadcast as a supported message transport
- Aleph maintains a Rust `p2p-service` that exposes gossipsub publication and
  subscription over HTTP and RabbitMQ
- we do not yet have source-backed evidence that raw pubsub alone gives us the
  same durable indexed behavior as the current REST/CCN write path

## Remaining Requirements

The main requirements and caveats left for end-to-end live validation are:

- an EVM private key available as `ALEPH_BOOTSTRAP_TEST_PRIVATE_KEY` or
  `ALEPH_PRIVATE_KEY`
- small indexing delay on Aleph before a newly published `POST` appears in
  `posts.json`
- dedicated `channel` and `ref` values if you want isolation from the shared
  `simple-todo` namespace during testing
- browser consumers still need their own project-level checks because bootstrap
  discovery can be correct while unrelated app type errors still exist

## Next Implementation Focus

The main unfinished work for this feature is no longer basic publish/discover
mechanics. It is completing the stronger same-root signing path across all
relay profiles:

- the wallet that deployed the relay VM
- the key that refreshes the bootstrap record from the relay
- the `peerId` that other relays and clients actually dial

The planned implementation direction is:

1. keep the current dual-key authorization payload from owner key `A` to relay
   key `B`
2. keep the relay-signed bootstrap payload that key `B` refreshes
3. validate the new same-root `peerId <- B` model on real deployments for both
   relay profiles
4. teach consumers to require dual-key verification by default once the relay
   producers all emit it
5. keep actual liveness checks at dial time rather than trying to prove
   liveness from Aleph alone

## Consumer Notes

`universal-connectivity/js-peer` and `simple-todo` should use this package in
place of hardcoded bootstrap multiaddrs or direct `@libp2p/bootstrap` static
lists.
