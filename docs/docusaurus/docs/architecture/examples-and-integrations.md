# Examples And Real Integrations

`shared-aleph-tooling` needs two kinds of documentation around usage:

- thin reference examples
- links to real integrations

Those are related, but they are not the same thing.

## Reference Examples

The `examples/` directory in this repository is for thin reference skeletons
and integration shapes.

Use these when you want to show:

- how a consumer repository calls the shared GitHub Action or workflow
- how a Node consumer uses `@le-space/node`
- how a browser or PWA consumer uses `@le-space/browser`
- how a consumer keeps thin repo-local entrypoints while delegating Aleph
  implementation details to shared tooling

These examples should stay small and contract-focused. They should not become
copies of full production applications.

Current reference example folders include:

- `examples/github-action-consumer`
- `examples/node-deploy`
- `examples/relay-deployer-pwa-consumer`
- `examples/universal-connectivity-wrapper`

## Real Integrations

Real integrations stay in their own repositories and are referenced from docs
as the canonical implementations.

This is important because real integrations usually contain:

- project-specific workflows
- target-specific RootFS profiles
- application-specific UI and policy
- experiments and operational state that do not belong in the shared tooling
  repo

## Current Real Integration References

### `universal-connectivity`

This is the main reference for the shared workflow and deployment integration
pattern around libp2p relay targets such as `go-peer`.

Useful reference points:

- runtime/connectivity PR: `#343`
- Aleph workflow integration PR: `#344`

Use it to understand:

- how a consumer repo keeps its own workflow entrypoints
- how shared runners and actions are called from repo-local workflows
- how project-specific RootFS contracts and relay behavior stay in the consumer
  repo

### `aleph-libp2p-relay`

This is the main reference for the browser and PWA integration path.

Useful reference point:

- `relay-deployer-pwa`

Use it to understand:

- how a browser/PWA keeps app-specific UX local
- how browser-safe deployment logic moves into `@le-space/browser`
- how prepaid and AA-wallet policy can stay local while protocol helpers are
  shared

## What Does Not Belong In `examples/`

Do not move full production apps into `shared-aleph-tooling/examples/` just to
have “examples” in one repo.

For example:

- `relay-deployer-pwa` should remain in its own integration repo
- `universal-connectivity` should remain in its own integration repo

Those repos are better treated as canonical references than as copied example
trees.

## Future Integration References

As more projects adopt the shared tooling, they should be linked here as real
integration references.

Likely candidates include:

- `orbitdb-relay-pinner`
- `qauld`
- Bitsocial daemon and related web client flows

Each of those should only be added once they actually use the shared tooling in
a meaningful way.
