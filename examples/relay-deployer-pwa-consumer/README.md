# relay-deployer-pwa Consumer Example

This example directory is for the browser-side consumer pattern used by
`relay-deployer-pwa`.

The intended end state is:

- the PWA keeps its app-specific UX and prepaid or AA-wallet behavior
- browser-safe deployment logic is pulled from shared packages
- only thin app wiring stays local to the PWA

For the canonical real integration, see:
